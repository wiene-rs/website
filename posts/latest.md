## Rust Coding Group

## {{ datetime }}

Our aim is as a community to get together on a regular basis and work on personal or open source projects on our own machines.

Given the nature of remote events, we'll be conducting this over videochat.

Everyone is encouraged to join! No matter what your skill level is. Let's hang out and make cool stuff with Rust.

Don't worry if you haven't written any Rust yet. Folks will be there to help you get up and running!

Here's some ideas on getting started:

- Install Rust https://www.rust-lang.org
- Rustlings https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings
